### I’m an epidemiologist, environmental engineer, and Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.

I research strategies to improve health in low-resource settings by reducing environmental exposures to enteric pathogens. I received a PhD in energy & resources and a MS in epidemiology from the University of California, Berkeley, and an MS and BS in environmental engineering from Stanford University. My dissertation research evaluated safe water strategies for low-resource settings, for which I conducted fieldwork in rural Nepal. From 2021-2023, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University's King Center on Global Development.
