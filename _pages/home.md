### I’m an epidemiologist, environmental engineer, and Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University.

I research strategies to improve health in low-resource settings by reducing environmental exposures to enteric pathogens. My conceptualization of health is broad, including physical, mental, and social well-being, and I am particularly interested in interventions that increase gender equity. I have taught courses in epidemiologic study design, global health, and environmental justice. I received a PhD in energy & resources and a MS in epidemiology from the University of California, Berkeley, and an MS and BS in environmental engineering from Stanford University. My dissertation research evaluated safe water strategies for low-resource settings, for which I conducted fieldwork in rural Nepal. My current work is supported by Stanford University’s King Center on Global Development [Postdoctoral Fellows Program](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/leadership-and-staff/postdoctoral-fellows).
