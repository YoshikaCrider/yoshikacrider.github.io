I am an interdisciplinary global health researcher and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the King Center on Global Development at Stanford University. My research interests include developing and evaluating passive chlorination technologies to increase global access to safe water, the impacts of housing infrastructure quality on health and well-being, and the implications of these various interventions on gender equity. My research makes use of methods from environmental engineering and epidemiology. I am Japanese-American and a first-generation college graduate.
