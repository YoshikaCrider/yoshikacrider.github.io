I am an interdisciplinary global health researcher and a recent UC Berkeley PhD graduate. Starting in September, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the King Center on Global Development at Stanford University. My research interests include developing and evaluating passive chlorination technologies to increase global access to safe water, the impacts of housing infrastructure quality on health and well-being, and the implications of various interventions on gender equity. My research makes use of methods from engineering, epidemiology, and the social sciences. I am Japanese-American and a first-generation college graduate, and these are core parts of my identity as a researcher and educator.
